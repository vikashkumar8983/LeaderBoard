## Features

- **Contest Performance Tracking:** The website tracks the performances of contestants on Codeforces.
- **Database Integration:** User lists are fetched from a MongoDB database.
- **Codeforces API Integration:** Ranks are retrieved from the Codeforces API for a given contest to assign points to contestants.
- **Admin Functionality:** The website supports an admin login, allowing administrators to perform actions such as deleting, adding, or updating contests on Codeforces and managing participant information.
- **Contestant Page:** Displays the current and highest ratings of listed participants on Codeforces.

## Technologies Used

### Front-end
- **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

### Back-end
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js, facilitating the creation of robust APIs.

### Database
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used for storing and retrieving contestant and contest information.

### API Integration
- **Codeforces API:** Utilized to fetch ranks for contestants in a given contest.

This tech stack suggests a full-stack application where React.js handles the client-side, Node.js with Express.js manages the server-side, and MongoDB is used as the database. The Codeforces API integration indicates real-time data retrieval for contest rankings.
